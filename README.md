Sonic Hangman is a sonic themed hangman game. The words are randomly generated from character names, tv show names, and quotes. There is background music as well as audio for buttons. There is a folder for the audios I used and there is a folder for the background image. The source folder contains the credits for the background image/sounds, and index.html, main.ts, and styles.css are the main files I used for the functionality of the game.
